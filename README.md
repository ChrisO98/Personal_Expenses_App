personal_expenses_app

A new Flutter project using the coding language Dart to develop an Android application for personal expenses.
This application does not save your expenses to the storage device as this was a learning experience.

Used Visual Studio Code to develop the application and debug onto my android phone.

You can use an emulator from Android Studio select the Pixel 2 API 28 with system image Pie 9.0
